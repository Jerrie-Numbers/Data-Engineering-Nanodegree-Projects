# Data Lake Project

## Summary
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Data Engineer are tasked with building an **ETL pipeline** that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Datasets
### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the  [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

Below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema 
### Fact Table

1.  **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

### Dimension Tables

 -  **users**  - users in the app
    -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
 -  **songs**  - songs in music database
    -   _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
 -  **artists**  - artists in music database
    -   _artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude_
 -  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_

## Project Steps - ETL pipeline
- Load data from S3,  `dl.cfg`contains AWS credentials.
 - Write in  `etl.py`  to read data from S3. Processes that data using Spark to create Fact table and Dimension tables.
 - Write the data back to S3.
