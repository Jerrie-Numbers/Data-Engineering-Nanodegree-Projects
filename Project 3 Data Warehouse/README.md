#  Data Warehouse Project

## Summary
Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app.  
data engineers are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their music data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Datasets
### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the  [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song.

Below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this  [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim)  based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

Below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
### Fact Table

1.  **songplays**  - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page  `NextSong`
    -   _songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent_

### Dimension Tables

 -  **users**  - users in the app
    -   _user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level_
 -  **songs**  - songs in music database
    -   _song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration_
 -  **artists**  - artists in music database
    -   _artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude_
 -  **time**  - timestamps of records in  **songplays**  broken down into specific units
    -   _start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday_
 
 ### Staging Tables

 - staging_events_table - as in the Log Dataset
 *event_id, artist, auth, firstName, gender, itemInSession, lastName, length, level, location, method, page, registration, sessionId, song, status, ts, userAgent, userId*
    

 - staging_songs_table - as in the Song Dataset
 *num_songs, artist_id, artist_latitude, artist_longitude, artist_location, artist_name, song_id, title, duration, year*
   
## Project Steps

 - **Design schemas for fact and dimension tables.** Write a SQL  `CREATE`  statement for each of these tables in  `sql_queries.py`
 - **Launch a redshift cluster and create an IAM role** that has read access to S3. Add redshift database and IAM role info to  `dwh.cfg`.
 - **Build ETL Pipeline.** Implement the logic in  `etl.py`  to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.  Implement the logic in  `etl.py`  to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
